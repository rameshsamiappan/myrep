How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Beacuse the code was working earlier and some change introduced in the lastest code only created the problem

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Can revert back to any version in no time

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: Lesser number of versions and can logically view the difference
Cons: Chance of data loss if the commit is not performed on time. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Good

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log command to see the list of commits and comments
git diff first_id second_id to see the difference between these versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Absolutely Good

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For my projects
